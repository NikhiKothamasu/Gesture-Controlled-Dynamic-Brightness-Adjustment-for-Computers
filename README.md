# Gesture-Controlled-Dynamic-Brightness-Adjustment-for-Computers


Gesture-controlled dynamic brightness adjustment for computers involves using a webcam to capture hand movements and gestures. Libraries like OpenCV and Mediapipe can be used to detect and interpret these gestures. For example, a swipe up gesture can increase brightness, while a swipe down can decrease it. The recognized gestures are then translated into commands that adjust the screen brightness via system APIs. This technology provides an intuitive and accessible way to control screen brightness, enhancing user experience, especially for those with mobility impairments. It also offers convenience in adjusting brightness quickly during different lighting conditions.
